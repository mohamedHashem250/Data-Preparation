There're three main methods to deal with Categorical data to convert to numerical values to be suitable for learning.

In this Script, we use Titanic dataset as an example to learn how to deal with these features
so we learn about: 


    1- Label Encoder 

    2- OneHot Encoder

    3- Ordinal Encoder 

    Also, we deal with some features that have combination of string and numbers in each record

    Next Goal: how we use Embedding method in tubular datasets.
